# Portfolio

The purpose of this document is to track what parts of my portfolio I'm working on when I'm not directly on my Mac. Then, I can go back and pull the .md file directly into VScode.

**I suppose that means this could work for the rest of my projects, too...**

## To do

- Better styling for background
- Try using photos from Japan as the background
- If it doesn't work, try putting them in a card
- Update the contact section
- Find out how to add JavaScript

## Completed

- Update portfolio section with more projects
- Changed the background color of the splash page
- Changed the animation colors of my name
- Added project links to Navbar drop down

## Discarded

- Take the rainbow animation off the front page
