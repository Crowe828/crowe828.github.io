## Requirements

- Submit an updated portfolio featuring project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.
- Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring project 1 and two exemplary assignments.
- Submit an updated resume
- Submit an updated LinkedIn profile

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](hhttps://sites.google.com/2u.com/careerservices-webdev/coding-milestones/milestone-polish-online-presence).

Your updated portfolio should contain the following:

- Your full name
- Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
- A link to a PDF of your resume
- A list of 3-5 projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:
  - Project title
  - Link to the deployed version
  - Link to the GitHub repository
  - Screenshot of the deployed application
- Ensure that your portfolio is free of grammar and spelling mistakes

#### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

- Mobile-first design
- Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
- Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile:

- Professional profile picture
- Biography
- Your current location
- Email address
- Link to your portfolio
- Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.
- README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:
  - Title of app
  - Live link to deployed app
  - List of technologies used
  - 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is
  - 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app
  - License (usually MIT)
  - Contact information for you and any collaborators

- A heading with your name, phone number, professional email address, links to LinkedIn, portfolio and GitHub
