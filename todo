Portfolio ideas:
1. One long scrolling page instead of multiple
2. It's broken up into sections, such as:
    1. Splash image
    2. Portfolio work
        1. Have the projects appear in a 2 column grid
        2. Each image should have a filter over it and it's title
            1. Image is a link to the project
            2. Think of a way to link to the github repo elegantly
    3. About me
    4. Contact box
        1. Will include a place to enter your email and textarea to send a message
    5.Footer with:
        1. Links to my github and linkedin
        2. A back to the top button
3. Color scheme: monochrome, light (not quite white) to dark grey (not quite black)
    1. Should be darker rather than lighter, maybe only a few lighter sections
    2. A lot of white text on darker backgrounds
4. Make it fun and display my personality, such as:
    1. Rubik's Cubes
    2. Sarcastic/dry humor
